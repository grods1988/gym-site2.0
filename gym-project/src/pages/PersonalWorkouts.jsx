            <h3>JOHN HEERON</h3>
            <p>
              Whether youâ€™re new to boxing or a seasoned fighter, John can teach
              you a thing or two about keeping fit for the ring and
              understanding your opponent.

            <p>
              While he comes from the world of professional boxing, John takes a
              holistic approach to fitness, and is just as likely to throw you
              into a yoga class as he is to throw you around the boxing ring.
